# Alexa Skill: MVG Busfahrplan

This repo implements a simple Alexa Skill that lets Alexa retrieve live departure data for my local bus station in Munich, Germany.
(Publicly available skills were useless for me, as Alexa's voice recognition just wouldn't understand my bus station's name, which contains multiple unusual German proper nouns.)


This project is solely for my own educational purposes.
